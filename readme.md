# Visualisation plugin

  

Visualisation plugin is a visualisation data product that helps analyse our servers carbon and cup energy consumption.

This plugin can be plugged at any stage in pipeline but needs 3 specific data for visualtion purpose.

  

### Sample data needed

    [
    
    {
    
    timestamp: '2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z',
    
    name: 'server-1',
    
    'cpu/energy': 0.045017969268292685,
    
    'grid/carbon-intensity': 369.4212640011265,
    
    carbon: 16.63059510985655
    
    },
    
    ]

### How to feed data to report
Its as easy as mocking the data now. No need to send csv file explicitly by the end user. The visual plugin takes in an array of cpu consumption which can be generated by the 'mock-observations' plugin and thats it. Just send the array to it from your tree.

Example:

    ...manifest file
    
    pipeline:
    - mock-observations
    - cloud-metadata
    - teads-curve
    - watttime
    - operational-carbon
    - visualization-plugin
	    output-path: ./examples/outputs/emission-report.html


TO NOTE:
if the output-path is not specified here then it picks the default path of **'./examples/outputs/report.html'**


### Steps to run

npm i
npm link

head over to if repo

npm link visualization-plugin-gsft
ie -- --manifest .\examples\manifests\visualization-demo.yml --output .\examples\outputs\tryout
